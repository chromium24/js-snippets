    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p id="para2">
        Educator, nurse and founder of the American Red Cross Clara Barton was born Clarissa Harlowe Barton on December 25, 1821,
        in Oxford, Massachusetts. Barton spent much of her life in the service of others and created an organization that still
        helps people in need today -- the American Red Cross.
    </p>
    <p class="synopsis">
        A shy child, she first found her calling when she tended to her brother David after an accident. Barton later found
        another outlet for her desire to be helpful as a teenager. She became a teacher at age 15 and later opened a
        free public school in New Jersey. She moved to Washington, D.C., to work in the U.S. Patent Office as a clerk
        in the mid-1850s.

    <h2>
        'Angel of the Battlefield'
    </h2>
    <p class="war">
        During the Civil War, Clara Barton sought to help the soldiers in any way she could. At the beginning, she collected
        and distributed supplies for the Union Army. Not content sitting on the sidelines, Barton served as an independent
        nurse and first saw combat in Fredericksburg, Virginia, in 1862. She also cared for soldiers wounded at Antietam.
        Barton was nicknamed "the angel of the battlefield" for her work.
    </p>
    <p id="para4">
        After the war ended in 1865, Clara Barton worked for the War Department, helping to either reunite missing soldiers and
        their families or find out more about those who were missing. She also became a lecturer and crowds of people came to
        hear her talk about her war experiences.
    </p>
    <h2>
        The American Red Cross
    </h2>
    <p>
        While visiting Europe, Clara Barton worked with a relief organization known as the International Red Cross during
        the Franco-Prussian War of 1870â€“'71. Some time after returning home to the United States, she began to
        lobby for an American branch of this international organization.
    </p>
    <p>
        The American Red Cross Society was founded in 1881 and Barton served as its first president. As its leader, Clara Barton
        oversaw assistance and relief work for the victims of such disasters as the 1889 Johnstown Flood and the 1900
        Galveston Flood.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Later Years and Death
    </h2>
    <p>
        Clara Barton resigned from the American Red Cross in 1904 amid an internal power struggle and claims of financial
        mismanagement. While she was known to be an autocratic leader, she never took a salary for her work within the
        organization and sometimes used her funds to support relief efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
        After leaving the Red Cross, Clara Barton remained active, giving speeches and lectures. She also wrote a book entitled The
        Story of My Childhood, which was published in 1907. Barton died at her home in Glen Echo, Maryland, on April 12, 1912.
