        Kong Qui, better known as Confucius, was born in 551 B.C. in the Lu state of China.
        His teachings, preserved in the Analects, focused on creating ethical models of family and public interaction, and setting educational
        standards. He died in 479 B.C. Confucianism later became the official imperial philosophy of China, and was extremely influential
        during the Han, Tang and Song dynasties.
